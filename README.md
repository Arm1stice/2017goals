# Arm1stice's Goals For 2017
## What is this for?
I want 2017 to be a big year for me. As such, I want to set some goals for myself now. I'm not a big fan of New Year resolutions, as they usually aren't concretely defined. My intent with this, however, is to set goals for myself that will point me in the direction that I would like to go this year. By making it public, it will serve as a constant reminder to myself of what my goals are. By putting it on a GitHub repository, it makes it easy for me to track the changes I make to my goals throughout the year. Also, it allows people to suggest goals for me if they would like. So, without further ado....

## My goals
### Academic
This is anything to do with high school and/or college
- Graduate high school without a hitch
- ~~Get into ASU and Barrett~~ (Completed 1/1)
- Figure out my financial situation so that I can actually attend Barrett
- Begin college

### Gaming
Gaming is a big part of my life, and I would like to take it as far as I can. These goals will help me do that.
- Begin streaming ~3 days a week
  - I've wanted to stream for a long time, however I couldn't due to my poor internet connection. But now that my internet is going to be upgraded, I have the chance to stream, and I want to build an audience.
- Find a game (or two!) that have a significant competitive scene that I'm interested in.
  - League of Legends is definitely one
  - The other is probably going to be Street Fighter V
- Do more research into how the tournaments/leagues of each game function
- Research my collegiate esport possibilities and see what it takes to get on a collegiate team
- Actually get on a collegiate team

#### Game Specific Goals
##### League of Legends
- Figure out a main role
- Figure out a main champion
- Achieve at least Platinum V in Season 7

##### Street Fighter V
- Find a main and a secondary
  - I really like Cammy as a main, could possibly look at Chun Li as a secondary
- Get to Gold by the end of Season 2

##### osu!
- Break top 20k in standard
- Break top 5k in mania, and continue to work on 7K mania.

### Financial Goals
- When I turn 18
  1. Start a savings account
  2. Start an Acorns account
  3. Start a Robinhood account
- Pay off my car
